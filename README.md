## Introduction
Welcome to the Knight Rider Smart Car project! We have tried to develop an intelligent car equipped with ultrasonic sensors, motors, and a narrative code structure.

## Features
- Intelligent car with ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection
- Thrilling adventures inspired by Knight Rider
- Modular code structure for easy customization
- Realistic maneuvers including turns, U-turns, and overtaking
- Adaptive gear shifting based on sensor data

## Hardware Requirements
We've used the following hardware:
- Arduino Mega board (compatible with AFMotor and NewPing libraries)
- Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04 x3)
- Motor controller (L293D Motor Shield)
- LiquidCrystal_I2C display (for debugging)


## Code Structure
The code is organized into classes and methods, making it easy to understand and customize. Here's an overview of the key components:
- `Car`: Controls the car's movement, gear shifting, and maneuvers.
- `Eyes`: Simulates the car's perception with ultrasonic sensors and suggests adventure strategies.
- `RescueMission`: A periodic mission to rescue the Knight Rider when stuck.
